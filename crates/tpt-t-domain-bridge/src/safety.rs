//! The universal autonomy↔teleop safety state machine.
//!
//! `bridge spec.txt` §4.3:
//!
//! ```text
//! AUTONOMOUS → REQUESTING_TELEOP → TELEOP_ACTIVE → RETURNING_TO_AUTONOMY → AUTONOMOUS
//!                     ↓
//!               EMERGENCY_STOP
//! ```
//!
//! Semantics per state:
//!
//! * [`SafetyState::Autonomous`] — the domain drives itself.
//! * [`SafetyState::RequestingTeleop`] — the domain detected a fault and is
//!   asking for human assistance (see [`crate::assist`]).
//! * [`SafetyState::TeleopActive`] — the human is in control; the domain
//!   still enforces its own safety limits (speed limits, geofences).
//! * [`SafetyState::ReturningToAutonomy`] — the human released control; the
//!   domain blends setpoints back to the autonomy controller.
//! * [`SafetyState::EmergencyStop`] — the human *or* the domain triggered an
//!   immediate stop. Entered from any state; exit requires an explicit
//!   reset-to-autonomous after the fault is cleared.
//!
//! This machine composes *on top of* a domain's own operating state machine
//! (e.g. `tpt-t-marine-core::machine::MissionState`): the domain keeps its
//! domain lifecycle, and this machine gates who is commanding it.
